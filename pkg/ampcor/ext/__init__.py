Standardized access to CPU and GPU acceleration

The following conditions must be true before we can provide CUDA support:

 - the local host must have CUDA libraries and drivers
 - pyre must have been built with CUDA support
 - ampcor must have been built with CUDA support
 - the current host must have at least one compatible device
