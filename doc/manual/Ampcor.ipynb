    "In this notebook, we will describe the essential algorithms in the *ampcor* program, which is used to estimate the misregistration between two images. The basic methodology uses image chip cross-correlation in the image spatial domain.  A reference image chip with a particular dimension is defined in the first image, as well as a search image chip in a second image. The search image is larger than the reference image so it can be translated in two dimensions for cross-correlation.  This is done once at nominal image sampling to establish a coarse offset.  Once the coarse offset is found, the images are oversampled by a factor of 2 and the cross-correlation is recomputed.   The correlation surface is stored, and oversampled by a factor of 32, then the peak location is estimated by curve-fitting.  The peak location is then recorded as the offset.  Much of the program is book-keeping and oversampling.  The basic functionality is just two-dimensional cross correlation.\n",

    "Ampcor defines its own sinc interpolator function, which is designed to be fast on a cpu by precomputing a very finely sampled function (oversampled by 4K or 8K), and accessing the appropriate coefficients for a particular interpolating fraction by simply selecting the nearest appropriate offset.  The sinc is obviously truncated, and an important feature of this function is the ability to taper the amplitude of the function for a smooth transition to zero at the edge.  This helps preserve phase independent of the fraction of the pixel selected. \n",
